            "description": "Insulin resistance may have effects that lead people to respond more to stress, a new study suggests.\nUS researchers think that insulin resistance may have effects on the brain's emotional response that lead to greater negative feelings. Insulin resistance means that the body is less able to respond well to the blood sugar lowering hormone insulin. Insulin resistance is the main characteristic of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.\nThe study involved 331 adults who had their reactions to various images tested. The study used eye-blink response (EBR) methods to assess negative responses and an electroencephalogram (EEG) device recorded to track brain activity.\nThe participants wore electrical sensors on the face, head and under the eyes to track involuntary responses. The research team were therefore able to monitor how each person reacted to the images by noting their blinking and flinching movements.\nThe results showed that participants with higher levels of insulin resistance showed a greater startle response to certain images. \nAuriel Willette, an Iowa State University assistant professor of food science and human nutrition, said: \"People with higher levels of insulin resistance were more startled by negative pictures. \n\"By extension, they may be more reactive to negative things in life. It is one piece of evidence to suggest that these metabolic problems are related to issues with how we perceive and deal with things that stress all of us out.\"\nThe EEG was also used to measure brain activity when the participants were resting. The results showed the right side of the brain was more active in the those with either type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. Activity in the right side of the brain is more commonly associated with negative feelings or depression.\nParticipants with diabetes were also noted as having lower cognitive performance and less well-regulated cortisol levels (the stress hormone).\nLead author Tovah Wolf, a graduate student at the university, said: \"For people with blood sugar problems, being more stressed and reactive can cause blood sugar to spike. If people with prediabetes and diabetes are trying to reverse or treat the disease, stressful events may hinder their goals.\n\"Frequent negative reactions to stressful events can lead to a lower quality of life and create a vicious cycle that makes it difficult to be healthy.\"\nThe findings have been published in the Psychosomatic Medicine journal.",

            "description": "A scientific breakthrough which could improve the success of islet cell transplantation for type 1 diabetes has been developed by researchers from Cincinnati.\nOne of the most promising new treatments for type 1 diabetes in recent years has been the use of live insulin producing islet cells. However, one problem has been that a lack of blood supply to the islet cells has meant that many of the cells die whilst being prepared for transplantation.\nThe researchers have developed a new bioengineering process known as self-condensation cell culture which helps to speed up vascularisation in transplanted tissue. Vascularisation means to supply the transplanted cells with blood vessels that will provide oxygen and nutrients that the cells need to survive.\nSpeeding up the process means fewer islet cells will die and this improves the effectiveness of the transplant. Islet cells used in transplantation can be either human derived or made in the laboratory from mesenchymal stem cells.\nType 1 diabetes develops when insulin producing islet cells in the pancreas are attacked by the immune system. One way of treating type 1 diabetes is to take insulin by injection or by insulin pump.\nAnother way is transplantation. The main difficulty with transplantation is the fact that in type 1 diabetes, the immune system is still programmed to attack the islet cells. As a result, when transplantation is performed, people with type 1 diabetes need to take strong anti-immune drugs to prevent the immune system attack on the new cells.\nWhilst the research from the Cincinnati team does not address the immune system problem, it does help more cells to survive transplantation in the first place, which improves the effectiveness of transplantation.\nThe researchers state that more research is needed before they introduce humans to the self-condensation cell culture process. Two possible problems are that the islet cells may be rejected and, if using stem cells, it is possible that tumours might occur. Research will need to check that these problems are unlikely to occur before the method is introduced in humans.",

            "description": "Leading health experts have voiced concerns after the government's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) put out an open consultation over its intention to maintain guidelines aimed at reducing saturated fat intake.\nThe SACN's approach is to keep the current UK dietary guidelines on saturated fat that limit their recommended intake to 10% of overall energy intake. This level of saturated fat works out as about 30g for men, 20g for women and less for children.\nThey state that currently it is estimated that the average person gets 12% of their energy intake from saturated fat. Therefore maintaining the guidelines would aim to reduce saturated fat intake across the country.\nThe SACN draft review also states that: \"Dietary saturated fats should be substituted with unsaturated fats. [Foods like fish (especially oily fish such as mackerel, salmon and trout), unsalted nuts, seeds and avocado are sources of unsaturated fat].\"\nIt is worth noting that all of the sources of unsaturated fat mentioned are also good sources of saturated fat too.\nThe proposal is likely to be met with bewilderment from many people with diabetes that have achieved excellent improvements in their health from switching to a low carb, higher fat, real food lifestyle.\nSince the consultation opened, health experts have been quick to point out that there is no good evidence to suggest that saturated fat is harmful.\nDr Carrie Ruxton tweeted: \"HEALTH EFFECTS: Sat fat is not linked with any cancers, CVD/CHD mortality, stroke, cognitive impairment, blood pressure, risk type 2 diabetes. 'Adequate' evidence that sat fats reduce CVD/CHD events as well as total, LDL but also 'good' HDL cholesterol.\"\nDr Zoe Harcombe is a researcher who submitted evidence to SACN in March 2017, over a year ago. When the consultation opened, she voiced her dismay that her evidence was not given due consideration:\n\"In March 2017 I submitted evidence on saturated fat to a 'Scientific' Advisory Committee on Nutrition. They either didn't understand it, or they ignored it!\"\nDr Harcombe has a Phd in public health nutrition which included a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence used to draw up the low fat guidelines of the USA and UK in the years 1977 and 1983 respectively. Her evidence drew the conclusion that no strong evidence existed to support the move to reduce fat and saturated fat intake.\nThe SACN's consultation is open between Tuesday 8 May and Tuesday 3 July 2018.

This shows very good control of type 1 diabetes and represents a very low rate of hospital visits for young people with the condition.\nThe data was taken from an online survey of a social media group for young people with type 1 diabetes that are managing type 1 diabetes with a very low carb lifestyle.\nThe very low carb lifestyle used by the group is set out in the popular diabetes book 'The Diabetes Solution' by Dr Richard Bernstein. Dr Bernstein is a physician, and former engineer, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for over 70 years and has developed his method for managing type 1 diabetes over the course of his medical career.\nThe social media group used in the study is the TypeOneGrit Facebook group run by another engineer, Dr R D Dikeman. Dr Dikeman's commitment to managing his own son's type 1 diabetes has seen many parents of children with type 1 diabetes looking to emulate the same excellent results. \nThose that took part in the survey were generally children or young adults, with parents completing the survey for their children.

The researchers note that a next step is to see how well the very low carb lifestyle will work under randomised controlled trial conditions. This would be when a group of patients are split into two groups with one group following the very low carb lifestyle and the other following the standard type 1 diabetes dietary recommendations.\nMany people on the Diabetes.co.uk Forum report similarly excellent type 1 diabetes control by following a low carbohydrate lifestyle.\nThe study is published online of Pediatrics journal.",

            "description": "A US survey has found that one in 10 people with type 1 diabetes avoid travelling abroad because of worries about their condition. \nOver half of 503 people surveyed said they have endured trouble relating to their diabetes when going on holiday abroad. \nThe survey was a joint effort between researchers from the Sansum Diabetes Research Institute in Santa Barbara, the University of California, San Francisco, and the Diabetes Research Institute of Mills-Peninsula Medical Center in San Mateo.\nEach participant filled in a 45-question online survey about their long-distance flying experiences and how their diabetes was affected. \nThe results showed 71% of respondents had travelled long-distance by plane in the last five years, but nearly one in 10 admitted they had chosen to avoid travelling abroad because of worrying about their diabetes. \nMeanwhile, more than 50% said they had struggled to control their blood sugar levels during the first 24 hours after arriving their destination and many reported their main concern of travelling was losing their medication. Twenty-two per cent admitted they had run out of insulin during their holiday. \nThe authors said: \"A better understanding of the fears, difﬁculties, and needs of patients traveling with type 1 diabetes will allow for the development of individualized and practical resources.\"\nIn spite of these results, it is possible to holiday safely with diabetes, it just requires a bit more organisation that people who do not have the condition. \nFor those who rely on insulin, a doctor's letter is required to verify the medication is needed on board, and it is recommended to find out a bit of information about the available insulins in your destination should you require more or your supply is damaged or lost.\nStudy author David C. Klonoff, MD, said in an interview with  Endocrinology Advisor that these findings should help inform clinicians that greater awareness of the benefits of travelling advice could be of great value to the diabetes community. \n\"Clinicians need more sources of information to convey to their traveling patients with diabetes,\" said Dr Klonoff. \"A journey begins and ends at home, but the clinician needs to consider all aspects including the impact of time zones on the timing and dose of insulin and other medications.\"\nFor more information on travelling with medication as well a comprehensive list of travel guides, visit our Diabetes and Travel section.",

The audit will record how often each of these complications occur within hospital stays for people with diabetes.\nSevere hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar drops too low, DKA occurs when the body starts running out of insulin, HHS too is related to overly high blood glucose levels and foot ulcers can develop from unhealed damage to the foot like blisters and cuts.\nIt is hoped recording the number of diabetes-related complications that occur during someone's stay in hospital will help form new ways of working in a bid to prevent them from happening to future patients. \nFigures released last year suggested at least one in six of all hospital beds are taken by people with diabetes, and it is hoped this audit will help healthcare professionals be able to identify signs of complications earlier. \nAs part of the audit, healthcare professionals who work in hospitals are being asked to submit data on diabetes-related issues. The audit requires continuous data collection and the results will be compiled and released at a later date.\nA lot of the time people with diabetes are admitted for an issue completely unrelated to their condition, but according to NaDIA 2016, one in 25 of those with type 1 diabetes developed DKA because they were not given the right amount of insulin.\nA patient leaflet has been released so people can understand what is being done with their data and why.
